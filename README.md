# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely treatment and prevention.  
This project is a **machine learning–based heart disease prediction system** that analyzes key medical parameters and predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease.

The model is trained on a structured dataset containing patient health attributes and provides a binary prediction:
- **0 → No Heart Disease**
- **1 → Heart Disease Present**

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze patient health data
- Train machine learning models for prediction
- Achieve accurate and reliable classification
- Provide a simple and interpretable solution for early diagnosis support
